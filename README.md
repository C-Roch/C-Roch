- 👋 Hi, I’m @C-Roch, Computational linguist and former [Postdoc at Linguistic Data Science Lab](https://ldsl.rub.de/members/claudia-roch).
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Social Web Data Mining, GenAI, and more.
- 🌱 I'm enthusiastic to learn about and work into new interdisciplinary fields to connect my knowledge. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate with colleagues and students. I have signed up for GitHub's [Global-Campus-Teachers](https://github.com/education/teachers) program to teach AI-assisted programming with Copilot.
- 📫 I would be happy about professional exchange and can be reached via e-mail: claudia.roch@ruhr-uni-bochum.de
